# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-R
A typical credit card fraud detection project in R

This project is just the standard credit card fraud detection project.
I also implemented a graphical user interface for users to test the model using the given parameters.
The graphical user interface was created using the shiny package in R.
The dataset for this project was gotten from Kaggle.
The data in the dataset was generated synthetically from actual collated credit card data.
Credit to Erik Altman for producing this wonderful dataset
